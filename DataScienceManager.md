**AI-Driven Insurance Analytics**  
- **Customer Retention & Pricing**  
- *Situation*: Rising customer churn in APAC motor insurance portfolios.  
- *Action*: Led development of churn prediction models using longitudinal data and behavioral economics principles (A/B testing, personalized offers).  
- *Result*: **25% reduction in churn rates** and **35% lower acquisition costs** for Malaysian Takaful clients.  

- **Generative AI for Underwriting Automation**  
- *Task*: Streamline manual underwriting processes for health insurance.  
- *Action*: Trained Azure OpenAI models with prompt engineering to classify EMR data and extract risk factors.  
- *Result*: Achieved **90% STP rate**, reducing manual reviews by **70%** and accelerating underwriting decisions.  

- **Climate Risk Modeling**  
- *Situation*: Insurers lacked dynamic flood/wildfire risk tools in APAC.  
- *Action*: Built geospatial risk scores using NASA/JBA data and Azure Databricks, integrating building footprints and TIV metrics.  
- *Result*: Enabled **$10M+ in risk coverage** for SEA insurers and improved claims forecasting accuracy by **30%**.  

#### **Novartis** | **Senior Consultant, Analytics Solutions Manager** | Jul 2020 – Dec 2022
